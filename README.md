# My script collection

This repo contains just my (little) collection of scripts I daily use.

## Dependencies

On MacOS `greadlink` is needed to source the scripts:

```console
brew install greadlink
```

## Install

Just run

```console
git clone https://github.com/smsimone/scripts.git ~/.scripts && echo -e "source \"$HOME/.scripts/load.sh\"" && source ~/.zshrc
```

and you're ready to go
